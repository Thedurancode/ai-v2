Google Cloud Platform: Offering cloud computing services to businesses\n2. Google Workspace: Subscription-based productivity tools for businesses\n3. Google Play: Commission on app sales and in-app purchases\n4. Hardware: Sales of devices like Pixel phones, Nest smart home products, and Chromebooks\n\nDespite this diversification, advertising still accounts for approximately 80% of Google's total revenue. The company's advertising model is based on auctioning ad space and charging advertisers when users click on their ads (pay-per-click) or when ads are displayed (pay-per-impression)."
